# smart-payment
This project implements classes that make it easier to input payment information through UITextField 
instances in objective-c.
It primarly targets ease of input for the Credit/Debit card number, and expiration date, since these
two inputs need certain customizations, such as inserting spaces for readability, and auto-inserting
a '/' between the month and year of the expiration date.
